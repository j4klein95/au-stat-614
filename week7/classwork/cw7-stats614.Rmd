Null Hypothesis -> Ho: mew_f = mew_m -> there is no significant difference between
  the reaction time of females (mew_f) and males (mew_m).
  
Alternative Hypothesis -> Ha: mew_f â‰  mew_m -> there is a significant difference between
  the reaction time of females (mew_f) and males (mew_m).
  
p-value -> 0.5389; t-stat -> 0.62095; conf-interval -> -0.05960489, 0.11197155

Since the p-value is > the significance level of .05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
Also, since the difference of Ho (mew_f - mew_m) falls within the confidence interval, we have 
additional justification for not rejecting the null hypothesis.
